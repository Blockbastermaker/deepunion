Description: # deepunion
        A collection of drug discovery tools
        
        
        ## Installation
        Before you install deepunion, you may need to have numpy,
        pandas, rdkit and pubchempy install
        
            $ conda install pandas numpy
            $ pip install pubchempy
            $ conda install -c rdkit rdkit
            
        Then, download the package and install
        
            $ git clone http://github.com/zhenglz/deepunion.git
            $ cd deepunion 
            $ pip install -e ./
        
        
        ## Quick start
        1 Convert a molecule to a pdb file, given its smile code
        
        
            >>> # generate 3D conformation from a SMILE code and 
            >>> # save as a pdb file
            >>> from deepunion import builder
            >>> comp = builder.CompoundBuilder(out_format="pdb", in_format="smile")
            >>> comp.in_format
            'smile'
            >>> comp.load_mol("CCCC")
            <deepunion.builder.CompoundBuilder object at 0x7f0cd1d909b0>
            >>> comp.generate_conformer()
            <deepunion.builder.CompoundBuilder object at 0x7f0cd1d909b0>
            >>> comp.write_mol("mol_CCCC.pdb")
            <deepunion.builder.CompoundBuilder object at 0x7f0cd1d909b0>
            >>> # the molecule has been saved to mol_CCCC.pdb in working directory
            >>> # convert the pdb file into a pdbqt file
            >>> babel_converter("mol_CCCC.pdb", "mol_CCCC.pdbqt")
        
        2 Search a molecule "progesterone" from pubchem, add hydrogen atoms and optimize
        the structure and save the 3D coordinates into a pdb file.
        
               
            >>> # download progesterone and save it into a pdb file
            >>> from deepunion import downloader
            >>> down = downloader.PubChemDownloader()
            >>> m = down.get_compound("progesterone", type="name")
            >>> smile = down.get_smile(m)
            >>> # now convert SMILE to pdb
            >>> from deepunion import builder
            >>> b = builder.CompoundBuilder("pdb", "smile")
            >>> b.load_mol(smile)
            >>> b.generate_conformer()
            >>> b.write_mol("progesterone.pdb")
        
        ## Examples 
        Go to the deepunion/deepunion/test folder, explore the 
        scripts to generate PDB files from a list of smile file.
